# CS-2110-A4-Modeling-Bugs-with-Trees

In this assignment, we used trees to model the spread of an infectious bug. The root of the tree represents the
first person to get the bug; the children of a node represent the people who were infected by contact with
the person represented by that node. Recursion was used to explore and traverse the trees and a GUI was prepared to propagate a bug and visualize the bug tree.
